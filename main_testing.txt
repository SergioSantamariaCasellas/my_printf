Steps for executing with main:
      1. Inside Makefile:
                a. Delete tests folder path inside the SRC
                b. Change the executable name to whatever name you want.
                c. Where the $(NAME):	$(OBJ), just make it so it looks like this:

                        $(NAME):	$(OBJ)
			gcc -o  $(NAME) $(OBJ)
                   
                d. Back in the SRC:, you will add src/main.c \t \
      2. Delete the tests folder
      3. Create a main.c file in the src folder add the header file path in the beggining(#include "../include/my.h"), and test it! this is an example you can use:
         int main(void)
             {
                int num = 1;

                my_printf("my_printf : %d\n", num);
     
                return 0;
             }
      4. Enjoy!
